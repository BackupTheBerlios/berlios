<h2>About us</h2>

<p><b>Mission Statement</b>

<p>The goal of BerliOS is to provide support for different interest groups 
in the area of Open Source Software (OSS). Our aim is to fulfil a neutral 
mediator function. The target groups of BerliOS are on one hand the 
developers and users of Open Source Software and on the other hand commercial 
manufacturers of OSS operating systems and applications as well as support 
companies.

<p><b>The Team</b>

<p>Currently the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/staff.php">BerliOS team</a> consists of very few employees of 
<a href="http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/">FOKUS</a>.
