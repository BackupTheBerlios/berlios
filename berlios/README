These are the PHP pages for the www.berlios.de web portal.

Before being able install these pages, make sure that your web server has 
been configured to interpret '*.php.*' pages as PHP pages. Second, ensure 
that the re_create_links.sh shell-script has been called in the top-level
directory. This script recreates all symbolic links that are required to 
view the pages correctly.
