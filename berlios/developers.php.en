<h2>Developers</h2>

<p>A server-based infrastructure (<a href="http://developer.berlios.de" 
target="_blank">BerliOS Developer</a>) provides developers of Open Source 
Software with various services for enabling joint coordinated software 
development between people who live and work at different geographical places.

These services include:
<ul>
<li> Web space for projects specific websites
<li> Discussion forums for developers and users of project code
<li> Online bug and patch management
<li> Project documentation management
<li> Creation of mailing list 
<li> Management of questionaires
<li> CVS repository for versioning of code
<li> FTP space for releasing software bundles
<li> User management for restricting checkin access to CVS repository
</ul>

<p>The goal is also to provide financial support for developers through
paid projects. A developer has the possibility of being paid for their
existing project or taking part in a paid project financed by a company. In
both cases the resulting software will be Open Source Software (OSS). Project 
offers
and ideas can be presented and viewed at BerliOS' 
<a href="http://sourceagency.berlios.de" target="_blank">SourceAgency</a> site.

<p>Developers are also able to present their project latest releases at
BerliOS' <a href="http://sorcewell.berlios.de" target="_blank">SourceWell</a>
site. SourceWell is similar to <a href="http://freshmeat.net" 
target="_blank">FreshMeat</a> and provides an announcement services for latest
releases of OSS.

<p>BerliOS' <a href="http://devcounter.berlios.de" target="_blank"
>DevCounter</a> provides a service where OSS Developers can register
themselves and provide a description of their skills.
