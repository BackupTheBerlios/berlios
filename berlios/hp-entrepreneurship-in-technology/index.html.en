<h3>Summary</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">Due to the success and dissemination of Linux the idea of Open Source Software (OSS) is now known in industry as well as in the public. The BerliOS Open Source Center shall support and mediate between interests and needs of the different groups (like developers, users, distributors, support companies, etc.) and to promote dissemination of this market model. The main objective of BerliOS is to increase the level of awareness and to support deployment through mediation between free developers, commercial providers (e.g. software manufacturers, support companies) and users (e.g. small and mid-size enterprises as well as the public administration).

<h3>Background</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">The birth of the Open Source idea was in the late 70th when a project was started to develop a distributed News system for the Internet. Thereby the disclosure of the sources was absolutely necessary due to the fact that it should be possible to port the system to several different variants of the Unix operating system. After that in the year 1984
the GNU project was started with the goal to develop a complete free Unix-like operating system. At the beginning compiler and software development tools were realized. Later on system and network utilities were implemented. In the first phase the GNU software was very popular at universities and research labs, due to fact that the source code is freely available and the possibility to make enhancements as well as to adapt it to individual needs. Furthermore universities and schools like to use the open source code for teaching and studying purposes. Due to the absence of an operating system kernel at first the GNU components were developed for the proprietary operating system SunOS, ported to Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, SCO Unix, etc., and used as a replacement for or supplement to commercial components. The later development of the Linux Kernel and the bundling of kernel, utilities and applications to a complete operating system leverages the Open Source idea. Today Linux Distributions are offered by several companies e.g. Caldera, Corel, Red Hat, SuSE, etc.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm"><b>Developers</b>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">The development of Open Source software is done by individual persons or free developer groups. In doing so adequate wages is not the main motivation but rather the visibility of the developer, the public discussion of technical realization and the joint learning process are the motivating strengths for the commitment of individuals.
Due to the fact that the source code can be freely distributed, used and modified enables the participation and integration of interested persons in the development process which accelerates development cycles and leads to higher software quality. Due to foster the openness of free developer groups and to support the joint learning and development process the attractiveness of participation still can be increased significantly. Against the background of a serious lack of computer specialists the support of personal commitment leads to higher qualification and opens the possibility of a basic qualification for people which like to change their carrier direction. This can be a contribution to satisfy the keen demand for computer specialists. 

<p style="margin-left: 1cm"><b>Users</b>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">In opposite to commercial software the deployment of Open Source software shows substantial advantages. Costs for licenses cease to exist which leads to increase the competitiveness of companies. Due to the openness of sources developments can relay on it and adaptations to individual needs can be realized by the users itself or by software houses on behalf of clients. On the other hand open sources can be verified which is a pre-requisite to excite trustworthiness for a given solution. For commercial products only the behavior can be observed from outside. Therefore possibility for verification is only limited and the customer is forced to trust the manufacturer finally.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">The stability of Open Source solutions are mostly quite high, because bug analysis and correction are not only cleaned up by the software manufacturer but also by testers and users. Due to distribution and survey of the software wrong development directions and bugs will be recognized early yet during development phase. This leads to accelerate iteration cycles.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">The offer of Open Source software growth very fast because a tremendous number of people join in the development process.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">In spite of these obvious advantages the market penetration is not as high as in research and education area particularly with regard to SME's and public administration. The causes for these circumstances are on one hand a shortfall in knowledge about the offered Open Source alternatives, lacking knowhow or on the other hand missing professional offerings for consulting, integration and support. The knowledge about Open Source alternatives can be increased substantially by organizing workshops and information events as well as demand analysis and documentation. Thereby special requirements of particular trades has to be considered. It is important to point out and document already existing solutions and also to identify missing components which averts the usage of Open Source solutions today.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm"><b>Manufacturers, Distributors and Support Companies</b>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">The increasing deployment of Open Source software in the business environment will also create a higher demand for professional consultancy, technical support and training. This leads to job creation in a new dynamic industry sector. Business opportunities arise for information technology professionals and company start-ups offering Open Source expertise and technical support services.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">But also traditional software manufacturers recognize the advantages which offer the Open Source market model. New technologies gain a high dissemination whereby an establishment of industry standards can be reached. Furthermore interested users and free developers can be acquired for testing, maintenance and further development which leads to cost reduction and encourage the personal identification with the original manufacturer. Than increased personal identification with a manufacturer also enforces readiness to buy products.

<h3>Activity description</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">The main goal of BerliOS is to support the different interest groups in the area of Open Source Software (OSS) and thereby to offer a neutral mediator function. The target groups of BerliOS are on one hand the developers and users of Open Source software and on the other hand commercial manufacturers of OSS operating systems and applications as well as support companies.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm"><b>Users</b>

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">Besides private users of Open Source software small to mid-size enterprises (SMEs) as well as the public administration are important target groups BerliOS will address. It will be pointed out in which application areas entire OSS solutions are already available today and are applicable in production fields.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">In dialogue with the users of particular trades missing components will be identified, which still averts OSS solutions to come into operation today. The development of these missing components shall then be initiated by contacting software manufacturers or free developer groups to realize corresponding components.

<p style="margin-left: 1cm">Another main focus will be the provision of general information about the OSS community. Among other thinks this includes web-based documentation, databases for software, hardware and products, news, event notes as well as search engines.
Furthermore existing solutions into operation in particular trades are presented and documented. Discussion forums supports the exchange of experience between the users of OSS solutions. Finally the most important Web and FTP servers are mirrored to offer the world-wide developed Open Source software and documentation in the national (Germany) domain extensive and fast.
